Custom ESPHome components and Home Assistant visualization card for the Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor.

![Card screenshot](images/card_screenshot.png)

See [FLASHING.md](FLASHING.md) for flashing instructions.

## Overview

This project provides two main components for working with the Aqara FP2 mmWave presence sensor:

1. **ESPHome Components** - Custom components for flashing and controlling the FP2 hardware directly with ESPHome
2. **Home Assistant Card** - Interactive visualization card for viewing real-time presence data, zones, and radar tracking

## Features

- Direct UART communication with FP2 radar sensor
- Real-time target tracking with position and velocity
- Customizable detection zones with individual sensitivity settings
- Interference grid and entry/exit zone configuration
- Visual representation of sensor coverage area
- Zone occupancy and motion detection
- Interactive web card with full/zoomed display modes
- Firmware-derived report toggles and diagnostics for people counting, walking distance, sleep state, target posture, and radar debug logs

## Part 1: ESPHome Components

The ESPHome components allow you to flash custom firmware to the Aqara FP2 and integrate it directly with Home Assistant via the ESPHome API.

### Components

- **`aqara_fp2`** - Main component for FP2 radar sensor control and data collection
- **`aqara_fp2_accel`** - Accelerometer interface for mounting position detection

### Installation

For remote installation (once published):

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/hansihe/esphome_fp2
      ref: main
    components: [aqara_fp2, aqara_fp2_accel]
```

### Configuration Example

See [example_config.yaml](example_config.yaml) for a complete working configuration.

### Grid Configuration

The FP2 uses a 14×14 grid to map the detection area:
- `.` = Active detection cell
- `X` = Zone coverage
- Grids available: `interference_grid`, `exit_grid`, `edge_label_grid`

### Firmware-Derived Radar Options

The ESPHome component exposes several SubIDs found in the stock firmware dump. Defaults preserve the current component behavior for the already-used report streams.

| Option | Radar SubID | Default | Notes |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------|
| `people_counting_report_enable` | `0x0158` | `true` | Enables people-counting reports. |
| `people_number_enable` | `0x0162` | `true` | Enables current/ontime people-number reports. |
| `target_type_enable` | `0x0163` | `true` | Stock app labels this as AI Person Detection. |
| `dwell_time_enable` | `0x0172` | `false` | Enables dwell-time reporting path. |
| `walking_distance_enable` | `0x0173` | `false` | Enables accumulated walking-distance reports. |
| `thermodynamic_chart_enable` | `0x0138` | `true` | Enables thermodynamic chart reports; raw BLOB remains in `radar_debug`. |
| `sleep_report_enable` | `0x0156` | unset | Optional; enables sleep reports when configured. |
| `posture_report_enable` | `0x0157` | unset | Optional; enables target-posture reports when configured. |
| `fall_detection` | `0x0121` | unset | Optional fall-detection enable. |
| `fall_detection_sensitivity` | `0x0123` | unset | `low`, `medium`, or `high`. |

Optional entities decoded from simple firmware-confirmed report wrappers:

| Entity key | Radar SubID | Type |
|------------|-------------|------|
| `realtime_people_number` | `0x0164` | `UINT32` sensor |
| `ontime_people_number` | `0x0165` | `UINT32` sensor |
| `realtime_people_counting` | `0x0166` | `UINT32` sensor |
| `walking_distance` | `0x0174` | `UINT32` sensor |
| `sleep_presence` | `0x0167` | binary sensor |
| `sleep_inout_state` | `0x0171` | binary sensor |
| `sleep_state` | `0x0161` | text sensor |
| `sleep_event` | `0x0176` | text sensor |
| `target_posture` | `0x0154` | text sensor |
| `radar_debug` | `0x0201` and unhandled reports | diagnostic text sensor |

### Flashing Instructions

## Part 2: Home Assistant Card

An interactive visualization card for viewing FP2 sensor data in Home Assistant.

### Installation via HACS

This is the primary and recommended installation method.

1. **Add Custom Repository** (if not yet published to HACS default):
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Go to "Frontend"
   - Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right
   - Select "Custom repositories"
   - Add repository URL: `https://github.com/hansihe/esphome_fp2`
   - Category: `Dashboard`

2. **Install the Card**:
   - Search for "FP2" or "Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor Card"
   - Click "Download"
   - Restart Home Assistant

3. **Add to Dashboard**:
   ```yaml
   type: custom:aqara-fp2-card
   entity_prefix: sensor.fp2_living_room
   title: Living Room FP2
   display_mode: full  # Options: full, zoomed
   show_grid: true
   show_sensor_position: true
   show_zone_labels: true
   ```

### Card Features

- **Real-time target tracking**: Shows detected people/objects with position and velocity vectors
- **Zone visualization**: Color-coded zones showing occupancy status
- **Grid overlays**: Edge labels, interference sources, entry/exit zones
- **Display modes**:
  - Full view (entire 14×14 grid)
  - Zoomed view (active detection area only)
- **Interactive controls**: Click to toggle view modes
- **Sensor position marker**: Shows FP2 mounting location

### Card Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `entity_prefix` | string | **required** | Entity prefix (e.g., `sensor.fp2`) |
| `title` | string | "Aqara FP2 Presence Sensor" | Card title |
| `display_mode` | string | `full` | Display mode: `full` or `zoomed` |
| `show_grid` | boolean | `true` | Show grid lines |
| `show_sensor_position` | boolean | `true` | Show sensor position marker |
| `show_zone_labels` | boolean | `true` | Show zone names |
| `mounting_position` | string | from entity | Override mounting position |

## Contributing

This is an experimental project and contributions are welcome!

Documentation around usage, improvements, or general feedback is welcome. I have made this mostly for myself, so I haven't put a massive amount of effort into making it easy to use.

See https://github.com/hansihe/AqaraPresenceSensorFP2ReverseEngineering for more technical details.
